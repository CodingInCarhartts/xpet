  title: "Require OpenAI to Focus on Programming Models",
  target: "OpenAI Board of Directors and Sam Altman",
  description: `As a software developer and technology enthusiast, I've grown increasingly frustrated with the prevalence of emotionally charged debates surrounding language learning models (LLMs). It's disheartening to witness how discussions often devolve into ad hominem attacks, appeals to emotion, and false equivalences, rather than focusing on the substantive merits and potential of these technologies.

Given the current controversy surrounding OpenAI's announced deprecation of the 4o, it's imperative that future efforts are channeled into creating programming-based models. By concentrating on these, we can foster an environment where logical discourse prevails over emotionally driven rhetoric. Not only would this shift enhance the utility and precision of artificial intelligence, but it would also mitigate the grounds for unproductive criticisms.

Programming models are crucial for advancing technology, enabling innovations, and finding solutions to complex problems efficiently. OpenAI has pioneered incredible advancements in this field, and a dedicated focus on programming models moving forward would ensure that these technologies are developed responsibly and effectively.

Support this petition to encourage OpenAI to prioritize the development of programming models, setting a standard for others in the tech industry to follow. Let's advocate for a future where technology discussions are grounded in fact and logic, not clouded by misplaced emotions.

Sign this petition to help push for a more rational technological advancement trajectory by having OpenAI dedicate its resources solely towards programming-based AI models. Together, we can champion a tech future devoid of baseless emotional rhetoric.`,
